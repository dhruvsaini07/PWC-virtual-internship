# PWC-virtual-internship
Developed Power BI dashboards during PWC virtual internship to analyze operational efficiency, identify customer churn patterns, and assess demographic data for diversity initiatives, including Call Centre Dashboard, Customer Churn Dashboard, and Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard

1. Call Centre Dashboard: this dashboard highlighted the importance of efficiency and customer satisfaction by agents.

2. Customer Churn Dashboard & Customer Risk analysis: identifying patterns and reasons behind customer attrition empowering retention and loyalty.

3. Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard: these dashboards not only provided insights into workforce demographics but also played a pivotal role in fostering a culture of equality at all levels.

Through these PowerBI dashboards, I have learned how data can drive positive change and smarter decisions. Each dashboard has helped the organization grow by giving us better insights into the operations, customers, and team.
